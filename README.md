## Business Question
SuperFoodsMax decision-makers ask the data team to provide insights that can support a strategy to lift sales revenue by 5% over the next two years. Key personnel you consult suggest focusing on loyal (existing) customers and the conversion of new customers into loyal customers. They reveal that:
- a failure to lift the average spend of loyal customers is stagnating revenue growth
- first-time customers are not converting into regular (loyal) customers.
